# Restaurant reservations
**The service provides an opportunity to book tables in the restaurant. The hotel manager can register his restaurant and add tables and a scheme to the database. Users can book tables for a specific date and time. The manager also has the opportunity to book tables at his discretion. It should also be possible to write reviews for individual restaurants.**
